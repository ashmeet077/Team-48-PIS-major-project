PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Waste management is a serious problem in india. Indians are not aware about waste management and sorting of waste.Considering that waste is not useful they throw it on the streets which leads to environmental pollution. Most often people end up selling their scrap to some of the local “KABAADI WALAS”  who in turn give them a low value for the waste.

Most Indians don’t have the motivation to sort their own garbage as it seems a tedious job to do.It is a fact that the main problem faced during waste management is sorting the garbage that is why through our idea we want to give people an incentive to sort their own garbage.
